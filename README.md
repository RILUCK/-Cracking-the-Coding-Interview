# Face Recognition System - OpenCV - Python

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database. It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person by analysing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape.

## The 3 Phases
To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:

1) Face Detection and Data Gathering
2) Train the Recognizer
3) Face Recognition

## BACKGROUND ON FACE RECOGNITION
When you look at an apple, your mind immediately tells you: that is an apple. This process is recognition in the simplest of terms. So, whatâ€™s facial recognition? The same, but for faces, obviously.
